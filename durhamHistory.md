# History of Durham

"Durham has a long vand vaired history. It rose to prominence in the eleventh century with the construction of the Norman Cathedral, built to honour St Cuthbert who had helped spread Christianity across the region some 400 years earlier.

The Cathedral and the Castle represented the enormous power of the medieval Prince-Bishops. Even after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, Durham remained the political, spiritual and governmental centre of the North East until well into the nineteenth century. Its wealth owed much to the development of a mining industry, based on coal and lead. The online Durham Mining Museum records the terrible toll that was paid for this wealth – the lives of 20,000 men and boys were lost in the Durham coalfield – remembered in the annual Durham Miners’ Gala and procession of banners and brass bands.

## Old Durham

The history of Durham seems to go back to Roman times but little is known of Durham in this period. In the countryside on the south east side of the city we find Old Durham where in 1939 land near Old Durham Farm was being quarried for sand when a local man discovered Roman tiles. Further discoveries were then made that included a Roman bathhouse.

The name Old Durham, or Ald Duresme as it had been known in Norman times always suggested that this was a place of antiquity and a Roman road (called Cade’s Road) is known to have passed close to this area through neighbouring Shincliffe.

The discovery suggested a civilian settlement or farm occupied by ancient Britons who had become Romanised. Perhaps it was a villa of some kind and possibly linked in some way to the pre-Roman site at nearby Maiden Castle.

By strange coincidence of name the principal interest in the excavation came from an archaeologist called Canon Thomas Romans who was the master of nearby Sherburn Hospital.

Canon Romans recorded the details of the site but it was subsequently obliterated by the sand quarrying. It seems to have been occupied in the second and fourth centuries but abandoned during the third century for a period.

Roman roads point towards Durham city centre from three directions. Cade’s Road approaches from Chester-le-Street in the north and also approaches from Sedgefield, Coxhoe and Shincliffe to the south.

Another Roman road from Brancepeth and Brandon that was linked to Dere Street comes in from the south west. What course these roads take through Durham’s centre is, however, unknown although Roman coins and pottery were found beneath Durham Cathedral in the 1970s and 1980s. The Roman name for Old Durham is not known.

From the 1200s Old Durham belonged to the rectors of St Nicholas church in Durham Market Place before passing to Kepier Hospital in the 1400s.
